## Building Your First Operator

Now that you understand the fundamentals of Kubernetes and the Operator SDK, let's walk through the process of creating your first custom operator.

This guide assumes you have `operator-sdk`, `kubectl`, and a Kubernetes cluster (such as Minikube or Kind) ready to use.

**Best Practice:** Execute all commands within a Git repository and commit changes after each step as instructed. This approach will help you understand exactly what the Operator SDK and Makefile are doing at each stage.

---

### Step 1: Install the Operator SDK

Follow the latest installation instructions on the <a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue;">official installation page</a>.

**Example (macOS with Homebrew):**

```
brew install operator-sdk
```

---

### Step 2: Scaffold Your Project

Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a new operator project:

```
operator-sdk init --domain=hogwarts.com --repo=github.com/mariobris/operator-sdk-demo --plugins=go/v4
```

**Parameter Explanation:**

`--domain`
: Defines the domain for your Custom Resource APIs (used in API group names)

`--repo`
: Sets the Go module path for your project

`--plugins`
: Specifies the plugin version to use (go/v4 is the latest Go plugin version)

<p></p> <!-- end of definition list -->

Let's examine the newly created directory structure:

`cmd`
: Contains the main application code

`config`
: <a href="https://kustomize.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue;">Kustomize</a> manifests for deploying the Kubernetes operator

`test`
: End-to-end tests and utilities

`Dockerfile`
: Configuration for building a container image

`Makefile`
: Automation scripts for building, running, testing, and deploying your Kubernetes operator

`PROJECT`
: Metadata file defining the operator project configuration

<p></p> <!-- end of definition list -->

ðŸ“Œ **Commit all files at this stage!**

Next, let's create an API and controller:

```
operator-sdk create api --group=wizards --version=v1alpha1 --kind=MagicalOperator --resource=true --controller=true
```

**Parameter Explanation:**

`--group`
: Defines the API group as `wizards`

`--version`
: Sets the API version as `v1alpha1`

`--kind`
: Specifies `MagicalOperator` as the custom resource type (Kind)

`--resource`
: Creates the Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

`--controller`
: Generates a controller that reconciles the resource

<p></p> <!-- end of definition list -->

Use your IDE to see which files have changed (recommended) or check with `git`:

```
git status --short
```

**New and Modified Files:**

`api/`
: Contains API definitions

`controllers/`
: Houses the controller logic for managing MagicalOperator resources

`config/`
: Updated with new CRDs and sample manifests

`PROJECT file`
: Updated to reflect the new resource and controller

<p></p> <!-- end of definition list -->

This scaffolding provides the foundation for building a custom Kubernetes operator designed to manage "magical" resources under the **wizards.hogwarts.com** API group.

ðŸ“Œ **Commit all files at this stage!**

---

### Step 3: Update the CRD Schema

Open the generated `api/v1alpha1/magicaloperator_types.go` and `config/samples/wizards_v1alpha1_magicaloperator.yaml` files in your IDE side by side to define the structure of your custom resource.

**Example:**
<p align="center">
  <img src="/blog/images/operator-sdk/api-types.png" alt="CRD definition" />
</p>

The CRD is defined by creating a `MagicalOperator` struct in Go. Note the `+kubebuilder` comments (<a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue;">Kubebuilder markers</a>) â€” they are crucial for generating the proper CRD format.

**Key Markers:**

`+kubebuilder:resource`
: Adds SHORTNAMES to the resource (e.g., `shortName=mo`)

`// Comments`
: Provide descriptions in the CRD

<p></p> <!-- end of definition list -->

Run `make manifests` to update the CRD and observe how the CRD file changes. This command uses `kubebuilder` and its `markers` to generate the CRD automatically.

Now, install the CRD into Kubernetes and verify our new CRD:

```
make install
kubectl api-resources --api-group "wizards.hogwarts.com"
```

**Example output:**
```
NAME               SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                      NAMESPACED   KIND
magicaloperators   mo           wizards.hogwarts.com/v1alpha1   true         MagicalOperator
```

Explore the CRD structure:

```
kubectl explain mo.spec
```

**Example output:**
```
GROUP:      wizards.hogwarts.com
KIND:       MagicalOperator
VERSION:    v1alpha1

FIELD: spec <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    MagicalOperatorSpec defines the desired state of MagicalOperator

FIELDS:
  bar   <integer>
    Bar is an example field of MagicalOperator int.

  foo   <string>
    Foo is an example field of MagicalOperator string.
```

Not too difficult, right?

ðŸ“Œ **Commit all files at this stage!**

## Step 4: Run the Operator Locally

**Terminal 1:** Start the controller

```
make run
```

**Terminal 2:** Deploy a `MagicalOperator` object

```
kubectl apply -f config/samples/wizards_v1alpha1_magicaloperator.yaml
kubectl get mo
```

**Example output:**
```
NAME                     AGE
magicaloperator-sample   113s
```

**Note:** The controller uses your local kubeconfig when running in development mode.

## What's Next

You've successfully scaffolded and run your first custom Kubernetes operator using the Operator SDK! Your operator is now responding to resource changes locally. In the next part, we'll explore how to implement more sophisticated controller logic to handle resource lifecycle events and deploy your operator to a real Kubernetes cluster for production use.
